 * Description: Prompts the user to input on the next line a sequence of       *
 *              letters, blanks (simple spaces or tabs) and punctuation marks  *
 *              (commas, full stops, colons, question marks or exclamation     *
 *              marks) and displays the output as follows.                     *
 *              - Words (maximal nonempty sequences of consecutive letters)    *
 *                have their first letter displayed in upper case and the      *
 *                remaining letters in lower case.                             *
 *              - Any punctuation mark that does not follow a word with        *
 *                possibly spaces in-between is ignored.                       *
 *              - Any punctuation mark that follows a word with possibly       *
 *                spaces in-between is displayed next to the word.             *
 *              - Successive words with possibly a punctation mark attached    *
 *                to their ends are separated by a single space.               *
 *              - The first word, if any, is not preceded by any space.        *
 *                                                                             *
